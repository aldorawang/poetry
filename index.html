            <p>Hi, there. This is an interactive website for collaborative</p>
            <p>poetry that will make connections between people through</p>
            <p>a creative way of making poetry together. The purpose of</p>
            <p>this project is for people, especially poetry lovers, to</p>
            <p>interact with each other through reading others' lines and</p>
            <p>adding more lines into the poem. The project is based on</p>
            <p>the human social network. Nowadays, people like to post</p>
            <p>on social media, and there are always some fun and</p>
            <p>creative captions. People sometimes talk in a poetic way.</p>
            <p>There are chances for everyone to be a poet. This project</p>
            <p> is a place for people to express and collaborate.</p>
